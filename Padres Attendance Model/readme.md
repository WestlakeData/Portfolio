<b>Problem:</b> I have purchase season tickets despite living out of town</br>
Identify which games to target for resale, and which games to target for exchange.</br>
</br>
<b>Limitations:</b> I may exchange no more than 50% of tickets</br>
I may sell no more than 50% of tickets on secondary market.</br>
Tickets to low demand games may sell at a loss, or not at all </br>
